To prepare for the session, clone the example repository starting in branch `02_1_attach_openapi`. This is where we left off in 
the [Deploy Contract Track](../01-deploy-contract).

`git clone -b 02_1_attach_openapi https://github.com/maddingo/api-handling.git`{{execute}}

We install the contract to the local maven repository so that it is available for the next step.

`cd api-handling`{{execute}}

`mvn install`{{execute}}
